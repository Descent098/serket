# Serket

Avoid Getting Stung By Password Requirements.

## About the name

Serket is a godess in egyptian mythology typically symbolized with a scorpion. There are a few different etymologies of the mythology, but the spirit of the name is that venom and stings can be healing. An aphorism is that the strongest stings bring the tastiest honey.

Likewise recognizing how bad your password practices are can sting, but ultimately it should end in something better.

## Todo

- [ ] Fix issue with not being able to use functions when numbers go beyond 95^12
- [ ] Start animating changes

- [ ] Find common hash rate for common password encryptions in hashkat to break them
- [ ] Mention this assumes worst case for users, and for hackers. Real world it's more likely to be worst case users and best/better case hackers with PW lists
